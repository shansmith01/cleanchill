Sustainable energy in Afghanistan is on a lot of people minds at the moment it would seem. Just yesterday there was an opinion piece on sustainable living and renewable energy in Afghanistan which is worth exploring. The article does point out there may be a push for non renewable energy resources to be used in Afghanistan.

We would like to take the time to let you know that we are spending significant resources exploring the use of renewable energy and solar powered refrigeration in Afghanistan. We would also like to highlight the efforts of our sister company Sustainable Energy Services International and the work they have been doing over there which is highlighted in this video from Fast Company.
