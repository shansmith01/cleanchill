Well… The Cleanchill team got back from Sri Lanka four weeks ago.  A very successful trip all round.  The prototype system was all installed and running in a couple of days – with fantastic data gathered for the next design and manufacture stage.

Next stage is compiling the test results – which looks like 500l from 34 to 4 degrees in 4 hours for this model.  Similar performance expected from the 1000l system currently in design.

The Sri Lankan people are so friendly and  helpful – and we have a supportive client which helps.

Now getting heavily into the new refined design – much more simplified electronics and ease of assembly.

Onwards!
