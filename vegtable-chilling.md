A lack of reliable electricity is a major impediment for fruit and vegetable growers in remote locations. This results in either high costs of transporting produce and paying to have it chilled, or resorting to only selling produce during the harvest period. Our chilling solutions are ideal for refrigeration or freezing to extend the shelf life of fresh produce.

Our chilling solutions mean that growers can preserve their products and smooth their selling season over a longer period. Pomegranates for example have a relatively short harvest season, but can be frozen for up to 6 months.

An added benefit of longer selling windows for fresh produce is more stable prices. Growers do not face low prices when their produce floods the market during the harvest and customers are not faced with price spikes when produce becomes scarcer.

Fruit and vegetable chilling units can be used for individual farms or as a community resource.
